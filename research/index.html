We study crises characterized by large adjustments of aggregate consumption through
their microlevel patterns. We show that leading theories designed to explain aggregate
consumption dynamics differ markedly in their cross-sectional predictions. While theories
based on fnancial frictions predict that rich households with liquid assets should be
able to smooth consumption during bad times, neoclassical theories predict that these
agents would optimally adjust their consumption if crises severely affect their permanent
income. Using microlevel data on several episodes of large aggregate-consumption
adjustment, we document that rich households significantly adjust consumption relative
to their income, consistent with the permanent-income hypothesis of consumption
during crises. We discuss our findings' implications for the effectiveness of stabilization
policies that target consumption during crises. </i> </span> <big><big>

I apply the methodology of Dingel and Neiman (2020), and Mongey, Pilossoph,
and Weinberg (2020) to identify which jobs can be performed at home (WFH) and
are performed in close physical contact to others (CI) in Uruguay. My baseline estimates show that around 78% of the workers in the private canâ€™t WFH and 22%
have CI. Using data on the characteristics of households I find large heterogeneity
in WFH and CI across the income distribution, geographical locations, age groups,
education levels, and production sectors. In addition, I study the relation between
WFH and CI with the access to social insurance, hand-to-mouth propensity, intrahousehold insurance and job-automation risk. 
Finally, I show that my baseline estimates of WFH are consistent with ex-post survey estimations during the COVID-19
pandemic lockdown. </i> </span> <big><big>

One out of five entrepreneurs in the U.S. purchased their business. Motivated by this, we
study how the trade of firms is a mechanism through which productive projects and available
resources can be better allocated in an economy in which entrepreneurs are subject to 
financial frictions. We develop a general equilibrium model of entrepreneurship and frictional
trade of firms that captures salient features about the trade of private firms that we document
in the data. Gains from trading firms in our model arise from the presence of financial
frictions, with credit constrained firms being the ones most likely to be traded. We present
evidence in favor of our theory by documenting that younger, smaller, and high returns to
capital firms have the highest probabilities of trade, consistent with the predictions of our
model. We then quantify the importance of the market for firms for the aggregate economy.
Parameterizations of our model imply that the better allocation of capital due to the trade
of firms can account for about 6% of entrepreneurial output. </i> </span> <big><big>
