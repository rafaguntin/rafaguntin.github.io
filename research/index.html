In this article I develop an heterogeneous firm with default framework where firms are potentially 
exposed to liqudity problems, i.e., firm runs. Large corporate nonfinancial firms in the U.S. tend to 
borrow from multiple creditors and a large fraction need external financing to rollover their maturing liabilities. 
Creditors to these firms need to conjecture about other creditors' behavior, which can lead to multiple equilibrium. 
In one equilibrium, creditors coordinate (lend) and the firm continues operating as usual. In the other equilibrium, creditors fail to coordinate (run) and the firm fails.
The pervasiveness of liquidity problems — relative to solvency problems — has relevant policy implications. I propose
an identification strategy for liquidity problems by incorporating a realistic bankruptcy procedure to the framework.
Matching the model to several relevant moments of the U.S. economy I assess the role of coordination failures during crises and regular times. 
Lastly, I analyze the effectiveness of credit policies — implementation and announcements — that emulate the ones used in recent crises episodes.  </span> <big><big>

We study crises characterized by large adjustments of aggregate consumption through
their microlevel patterns. We show that leading theories designed to explain aggregate
consumption dynamics differ markedly in their cross-sectional predictions. While theories
based on financial frictions predict that rich households with liquid assets should be
able to smooth consumption during bad times, neoclassical theories predict that these
agents would optimally adjust their consumption if crises severely affect their permanent
income. Using microlevel data on several episodes of large aggregate-consumption
adjustment, we document that rich households significantly adjust consumption relative
to their income, consistent with the permanent-income hypothesis of consumption
during crises. We discuss our findings' implications for the effectiveness of stabilization
policies that target consumption during crises. </span> <big><big>

We study the relation between financial frictions and the trade of privately held firms.
In the U.S. one out of five entrepreneurs purchased their business, however, this number
has decreased during the last 30 years. Further, in the cross section, younger, smaller,
and high return to capital firms exhibit the highest probabilities of trade. We propose a
general equilibrium model of entrepreneurship and frictional trade of firms that explains
these findings. Gains from trading firms in our model arise from the presence of financial
frictions with credit constrained firms, which tend to be young and small, being the ones most
likely to be traded. Our quantitative exercises suggest that the better allocation of capital
due to the trade of firms may account for 5 to 8% of entrepreneurial output. Moreover, we
found that easier access to credit can explain 40% of the fall in the share of traded firms
observed during the last decades. </span> <big><big>

I apply the methodology of Dingel and Neiman (2020), and Mongey, Pilossoph,
and Weinberg (2020) to identify which jobs can be performed at home (WFH) and
are performed in close physical contact to others (CI) in Uruguay. My baseline estimates show that around 78% of the workers in the private can’t WFH and 22%
have CI. Using data on the characteristics of households I find large heterogeneity
in WFH and CI across the income distribution, geographical locations, age groups,
education levels, and production sectors. In addition, I study the relation of
WFH and CI measures to the access to social insurance, hand-to-mouth propensity, intrahousehold insurance and job-automation risk. 
Finally, I show that my baseline estimates of WFH are consistent with ex-post survey estimations during the COVID-19
pandemic lockdown.  </span> <big>
